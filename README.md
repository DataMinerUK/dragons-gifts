## The project

From dams to super-highways, from mining sites to research centers, from the African Union headquarters to more than 40 Confucius institutes, the Chinese presence in Africa takes shape in several ways.  

Some analysts talk about soft power. Others raise the alarm over a Chinese invasion. The Chinese government constantly emphasizes the friendship between the people of China and Africa. Such confusion engengers a thick blanket of fog that covers the Chinese investments in Africa.  

Start the tour and have a look at the Chinese projects in Africa, or explore the data and delve into the Chinese presence in the African continent.
