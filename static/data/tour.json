    "description":"(PPIAF-ID:256) In December 2003, the China Exim Bank approved a $519 million USD loan for the construction of the 1,250 MW Merowe hydroelectric dam. The dam is located at longitude 32 E, and latitude 19 N. The dam was constructed by a joint venture of China International Water Electric Corp. and SinoHydro. The project was completed around the beginning of 2009. The actual start date is unknown. An estimated 60,000 civilians were displaced by the construction. Sudanese civilians protested the projectâ€™s execution from the start, and in a confrontation by authorities in April 2006, five people from a displaced community were killed. STAFF_NOTE: The International Rivers report on this dam listed the project value at $1.5 billion, which probably includes the construction of the transmission line system, ID#695.",

    "description":"(PPIAF) Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) was awarded the contract for the modernization of Nigeria's one-track rail line to standard gauge rail project. The first phase includes part of the 1,313 km railway from Lagos to Kano, the portion from Abuja to Kaduna. The project is worth $8.3 billion USD (which was downsized to $8 billion USD in 2009), and China has loaned the Nigerian government $2.5 billion to finance refurbishment of the railway system. This contract was signed between Nigeria and CCECC on Oct. 30, 2006. The project was originally proposed in 2002 and was to be financed by a $1 billion soft loan from the Export-Import Bank of China. In order to release funding pressures, the project would be implemented in phases.The first phase of the project is a single track railway 186.5 km in length with a contract value of $849,750,903 USD and a construction period of 36 months.The second phase of the project is the Lagos-Ibadan section of the railway, a double-track railway with a total length of 156.8km and a design speed of 150km per hour for both passengers and freight transportation. This portion is worth approximately $1.487 billion USD with a construction period of 36 months. PPIAF-ID:206 However, A Deborah Brautigam China in Africa blogpost from [December 2010 reported that after CCECC won the $8.3 billion contract, the Chinese government had offered a line of export credit for $2 billion at a 'competitive commercial rate,' as well as a preferential export credit at $500 million. These tied credits were considered as potential funding for projects other than the railway, but eventually the $2 billion credit was never used and expired. The $500 million preferential credit was renewed and may be being used to fund a part of the railway infrastructure project. The exact flow type is not known, because Deborah Brautigam referred to the commitment as an export credit, but the Nigerian Federal government was reported as calling it a concessional loan. ",
