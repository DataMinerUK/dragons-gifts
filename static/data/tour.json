In May 2007, China agreed to spend $150 million to expand the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Then, on January 11, 2008, China signed an addition agreement for a $61 million conference center attached to the headquarters. Construction of the headquarters began in January 2009, and both of the buildings were inaugurated on January 28, 2012. The ultimate cost of both components was estimated at $200 million. 1,200 Chinese and Ethiopian workers were involved in the project. ",

    "description":"(PPIAF) Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) was awarded the contract for the modernization of Nigeria's one-track rail line to standard gauge rail project. The first phase includes part of the 1,313 km railway from Lagos to Kano, the portion from Abuja to Kaduna. The project is worth $8.3 billion USD (which was downsized to $8 billion USD in 2009), and China has loaned the Nigerian government $2.5 billion to finance refurbishment of the railway system. This contract was signed between Nigeria and CCECC on Oct. 30, 2006. The project was originally proposed in 2002 and was to be financed by a $1 billion soft loan from the Export-Import Bank of China. In order to release funding pressures, the project would be implemented in phases.The first phase of the project is a single track railway 186.5 km in length with a contract value of $849,750,903 USD and a construction period of 36 months.The second phase of the project is the Lagos-Ibadan section of the railway, a double-track railway with a total length of 156.8km and a design speed of 150km per hour for both passengers and freight transportation. This portion is worth approximately $1.487 billion USD with a construction period of 36 months. PPIAF-ID:206 However, A Deborah Brautigam China in Africa blogpost from [December 2010 reported that after CCECC won the $8.3 billion contract, the Chinese government had offered a line of export credit for $2 billion at a 'competitive commercial rate,' as well as a preferential export credit at $500 million. These tied credits were considered as potential funding for projects other than the railway, but eventually the $2 billion credit was never used and expired. The $500 million preferential credit was renewed and may be being used to fund a part of the railway infrastructure project. The exact flow type is not known, because Deborah Brautigam referred to the commitment as an export credit, but the Nigerian Federal government was reported as calling it a concessional loan. ",
